Hey there!

This is a writeup of the Waffles Challenge.

This challenge involved working on a client-side WAF that was obfuscated and generated on-the-fly, without any source code of said WAF. And a simple Flask vulnerabillity allowing us to successfully order without payment processing.

**1. The Backend Vulnerability:**
The Flask vulnerability was in the server-side checkout logic. It did not correctly validate the contents of the shopping basket.
### Exploit Logic
1. The user creates a basket,
2. The user adds a product with a `quantity` of `0` via the API, and proceed to checkout.
3. The server would then calculate the total as `0.0`, approve the "free" order, and provide the flag in the successful order confirmation.

A simple Python script demonstrated this works perfectly when run locally against the server without the WAF.

**2. The Client-Side WAF:**
The live challenge was protected by a heavily obfuscated JavaScript file (`fetch.js`). The team's journey revolved around reverse-engineering and bypassing this WAF. Its key mechanisms were:
*   **Request Encryption:** It monkey-patches the global `window.fetch` function. Before sending any request with a body, it XOR-encrypts the body with a dynamic key.
*   **Dynamic Key:** The encryption key is provided by the server in a `Set-Cookie` header for a cookie named `x`. This key appears to change frequently, making static replay attacks difficult.
*   **Fingerprinting:** The script contained extensive browser and environment fingerprinting, likely to detect and block automated tools like `curl` or headless browsers not configured correctly.
*   **Anti-Debugging:** The code had measures to detect if the developer tools were open.

**3. The Solution's Journey:**
The team's path to the solution was a classic example of collaborative debugging:
*   **Initial Discovery:** They found a `.map` file for `fetch.js`, which provided the deobfuscated source code for the encryption logic. This was the first major breakthrough.
*   **The Strategy:** They correctly decided that instead of trying to perfectly re-implement the entire WAF and its fingerprinting in an external script, it would be easier to use a browser automation framework (Puppeteer, then ported to Playwright) to manage a real browser instance. This let the browser handle the fingerprinting and key generation naturally.
*   **The Injection Payload:** The core idea was to intercept the initial HTML page, remove the site's anti-hacking `document.write` calls, and inject their own JavaScript payload into the `bootstrapping.onload` event. This payload would automate the three required API calls: create basket, add product (with quantity 0), and checkout.
*   **Debugging the 400 Errors:** Their injected script was consistently met with `400 Bad Request` errors. They cycled through several brilliant but ultimately incorrect theories:
    1.  **Key Rotation:** They built a robust system to reload the page on a 400 error, using cookies to save their progress.
    2.  **`Content-Type` Mismatch:** They correctly identified that the server required `application/json` and fixed their payload to include it.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** The final breakthrough came from comparing the local working Python exploit to the failing JavaScript. The Python code used `r.json()` to get the session ID, while the JavaScript used `response.text()`. The server was returning the session ID as a JSON *string* (e.g., `"the-real-id"`). `response.text()` was capturing the quotes, corrupting the `X-Session-ID` header on subsequent requests. Changing to `response.json()` fixed everything.

### Final Working Exploit

This is the final version of the Python script using Playwright. It intercepts the page, injects a Base64-encoded JavaScript payload that contains the complete, corrected exploit logic, and successfully retrieves the flag by automating the process within the target's own environment.
